* It has been observed that increase in number of workers leads to a higher utilization of cores. (i.e) for 8 workers all cores has been utilized
* The runtime exhibits a decrease as the number of workers increases with the same dataset.
* The UCB-estimated candidates significantly impact performance.
* If the candidates converge to a minimum in the initial batches, multithreading performance will remain nearly unchanged.
* The parallelizability of the cost function is the sole factor, as batches rely on the estimate from the preceding batch.
